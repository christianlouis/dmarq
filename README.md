# DMARQ

**DMARQ** is a modern, privacy-conscious DMARC monitoring and analysis platform built for professionals who want deep visibility into their email authentication posture — without giving up control or relying on third-party SaaS providers.

🌐 [Live Demo (soon)](https://app.dmarq.org)  
🔒 Self-hosted. Secure. Beautifully visual.  
🛠️ Docker-deployable. Cloudflare-integrated.  
📬 Aggregate & forensic report support.

## 💡 What is DMARQ?

DMARQ ingests and visualizes DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) reports — both aggregate and forensic — to help domain owners understand who is sending emails on their behalf and whether those messages are properly authenticated using SPF and DKIM.

No more guessing. See which services are passing DMARC, which are failing, and how to fix them — all in one clear dashboard.

## 🚀 Current Status - Milestone 1 Completed

We have achieved **Milestone 1: Basic DMARC Monitoring**. This milestone includes:

- ✅ DMARC XML report parsing (supports XML, ZIP, and GZIP formats)
- ✅ In-memory storage of report data for up to 5 domains
- ✅ Simple dashboard UI showing DMARC compliance statistics
- ✅ Support for uploading and processing DMARC aggregate reports
- ✅ Domain overview with compliance rates and email statistics

You can now:
1. Upload DMARC aggregate reports via the web interface
2. View summary statistics across all monitored domains
3. Drill down into domain-specific details and reports
4. Track compliance rates and authentication failures

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Dashboard & Reports
- **DMARC Compliance Rate**: Track pass/fail rates over time
- **Enforcement Rate**: Visualize policy strength and adoption
- **Volume & Trends**: Identify traffic spikes and anomalies
- **Top Sending Sources**: Detect unknown or unauthorized senders
- **Forensic Reports**: Analyze failure samples (RFC 6591 support)

### 🛡 DNS Record Health
- Inspect **SPF**, **DKIM**, **DMARC**, **MX**, and **BIMI** records
- Show which records are missing, broken, or invalid
- Get **fix suggestions** tailored to your provider (e.g., Google, Microsoft)
- 🔒 No automatic changes — all DNS updates require explicit confirmation

### 🌐 Cloudflare Integration
- Automatically discover domains in your Cloudflare account
- Fetch and analyze relevant DNS records
- Suggest missing or malformed entries
- Track configuration changes over time (coming soon)

### ⚙️ Web-Based Setup Wizard
- Guided onboarding experience (no CLI setup required)
- Store all configuration in a secure internal database
- Seed config with environment variables for headless deployment

### 🚨 Alerts & Notifications
- Integration with [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise)
- Email, Slack, webhook, and more
- Alert on new failures, compliance drops, or unknown senders

### 🔐 User Management
- Built-in authentication via **FastAPI Users**
- JWT-secured API endpoints
- Admin dashboard access control
